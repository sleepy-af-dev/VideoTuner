## vapoursynth-zip (vszip)

**Location:** `vapoursynth-portable/vs-plugins/vszip.dll`\
**License:** MIT License\
**Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2024 Julek

## FFMS2

**Location:** `vapoursynth-portable/vs-plugins/ffms2.dll`, `ffmsindex.exe`\
**License:** GNU General Public License v3.0 (for binaries linked with GPL FFmpeg)\
**Copyright:** Copyright (C) 2007-2024 FFMS2 contributors

The FFMS2 source code is MIT licensed, but Windows binaries are distributed under GPL v3 due to being linked with GPL-licensed FFmpeg components.

The bundled binary is built from source during the release rather than taken from an upstream archive, because 5.0 is the newest binary FFMS2 has published. `.github/scripts/build-ffms2.ps1` records the exact upstream commit it builds and the FFmpeg version it links, so the corresponding source is identified by that commit in the repository linked above.
